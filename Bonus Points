Exception handling:
  1- I have written a mechanism for generic exceptions handling using asp.net core middleware. 
Security
  1- I would implement OAUTH protocol to secure API's from unauthorized access.
  
API documentation
  - I have integrated swagger for documentation of API
Testing
  - Unit testing framework should be implemented for testing of features.
  
Logging
  - A separate layer for Logging will be implemented as you can see in solution I have created a folder for Loggin
Fault Tolerance
  - API's monitoring mechanisms can be applied to see the performance of API's and alerts in case anything goes wrong in production
Performance
  - Performance in sense of load / robustness will be done and code will be effecient enough to handle non-functional requirements
